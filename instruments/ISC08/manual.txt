Control with ISC08 from stepperonline

The switch mounted above the Arduino disables the motor. Keep in the down
  position any time you don't want the motor to move.

! IMPORTANT !
! If the motor switch is active (up) during power-up or restart the motor can
!  move in unpredictable ways. Reconennecting serial causees the Arduino to
!  restart. 
  
Connect Serial with these settings.
Baud Rate: 57600 
Bits: 8
Parity: none
Stop Bits: 1

Command Format:
lddd... (letter; two digits; one or more digits)

The letter is 'f' for forward or 'r' for reverse.

The next two digits are 00 to 99 to set the speed.

The final number is the time in tenths of a second.

Examples:
r5555<CR>    This will move out at speed 55 for 5.5 seconds
f109<CR>    This will move in at speed 10 for 0.9 seconds

Additional commands are the letter 'i', 'q' and 's'. Currently 'i' returns device ID,
  's' is STOP and 'q' is set to move out at speed 60 for 5 seconds.
These commands do not need any other characters to work
Any key will stop the motors current movement but anything other than 's'
  will begin a new command or return an error.

Everything is Expert Mode so there is almost no error checking.
If 'f' or 'r' is entered without speed and time results will be unpredictable.
